# ML
In this project I have work on the dataset of the bengaluru home price which I have gathered from the kaggle.com

Throughout the project , I have build a model which predicts the prices of the house as per their location  , bedrooms , square ft area and etc.
During model building , the ml algorithm and techniques that are covered such as data load and cleaning, outlier detection and removal, feature engineering, dimensionality reduction, gridsearchcv for hyperparameter tunning, k fold cross validation etc. so that to enhance the predictive power. 

Technology and tools that are used are :-
    - Python
    - Numpy and Pandas for data cleaning
    - Matplotlib for data visualization
    - Sklearn for model building
    - Jupyter notebook
